When speaking with Glenn on the phone during the intial phone screen, I informed him that I had not worked with react in about four years. Despite this, I decided to do coding exercise 5 in react and I have learned a ton just in the day that I spent working on the challenge. I could have coded the app in Angular and Typescript, which is what I am more used to, but, I hope that in coding it in react you see my commitment to this team and my eagerness to learn all of the new technologies that come with this position. I look forward to speaking with you!
