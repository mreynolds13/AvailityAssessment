My proudest achievement would have to be when I created an entire RDP server farm for my current company. When covid first hit and everyone started working from home it was quickly realized that are RDP servers were not doing their jobs well. The business need was decided that these servers would need to be updated and reworked because of their increased use from the at-home workers. I, who didnt even know what RDP even stood for at the time, raised my hand to take on the project. Working through that project has been one of the most fun and challenging projects that I have ever worked on. The challenge came from all of the new exposure to technologies that I had only heard about but had never had any training or experience with. I had the chance to learn about CI\CD build and release processes through yaml pipelines, Infrastructure as code using Azure ARM templates, virtual machine imaging using packer, networking concepts by having the servers in Azure Vnets\subnets and firewall rules, and finally how to traffic manage and load balace traffic coming to the servers. The most exciting thing about the project was going from almost zero knowledge of what I was getting myself into to having a piece of infrastructure out in Azure that is used every day by people of my organization.
